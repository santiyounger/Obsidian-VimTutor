This is a modification of vimtutor made for obsidian.


# What Is Vimtutor
vimtutor is usually presented as one long file which comes with a new installation of vim.

The purpose of vimtutor is to provide strong foundation for new vim users.

# Why Format This For Obsidian
Obsidian has a way to activate Vim key bindings.

you can turn it on by going to:
`Settings > Editor > Vim Key Bindings`

vimtutor helped get started with vim in just one week. If it wasn't for vimtutor I would have given up on vim straight away. Vim now allows me not only to format text extremely fast, but it has quickly become a new way to think about shortcuts.

The main reason why I decided to give Obsidian was because it supported vim-mode.

# What Has Changed In This Version
You can always use the original vimtutor if you install real vim, this version will omit aspects of vim that are not available or applicable in Obsidian.

There will also be some tips and particular aspects of using vim in Obsidian.
